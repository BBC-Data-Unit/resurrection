In April 2017 we reported that [a quarter of people who describe themselves as Christians in Great Britain do not believe in the resurrection of Jesus](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-39153121), according to a survey commissioned by the BBC.

ComRes surveyed 2,010 British adults by telephone, between 2 and 12 February 2017. The research was commissioned by BBC local radio for Palm Sunday.
